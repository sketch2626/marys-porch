# Where things stand

Facts only: what's happening now, what's waiting on Andy, and what's next. The spirit is in `docs/mission.md`, the rules in `docs/decisions.md` and `docs/how-we-work.md`, and each item in detail in `docs/mary-roadmap.md`. The log through 2026-11-04 is in `docs/archive/status-2026-11-04.md`.

## Right now (2026-11-05)
- **Mary today:** v0.5.0 (installer 336 MB, zip 401 MB), on the free Gemini tier for Andy's own testing (D21). Three brains sit behind the `mary_brain` test switch: full (the default), lean (`mary/lean.md`, tag `lean-v1`) and leaner (`mary/leaner.md`). Andy picks one with the paid model (D19).
- **Her brain waits on the paid model,** Gemini's paid tier or the Claude API, which Andy is choosing. Personality work on today's cheap model stopped on 2026-11-04. Testing until then follows D26.
- **M18b is merged and published** (2026-11-05, 2686 tests OK; brief `docs/handoff/done/M18b.md`). Mary opens and fills screens by voice in Normal and Offline, not only Live; Offline fills only plain text and phone boxes and says plainly what it can't do. A person is added by voice in every mode, and the book list has one line telling a typing helper how. Removing a note or the email account by voice asks "are you sure?" first. Not tried yet with a real model or in the real app (D26). Its session is archived and its branch deleted.
- **M24, the porch scene:** round 5 is done on `other/M24-scene` (not merged; brief `docs/handoff/done/M24-scene5.md`). It has Andy's layout, a cartoon face, a matte finish with no glare, a darker mood, evening, night (`?time=night`, Andy's favorite) and a calm day (`?time=day`), a real old lantern Mary turns up or down (`?lamp=`, `?pose=lamp`), and a soft radio glow. Still open: the turned-down lantern glass stays a bit pale, the day sky reads a little gloomy, and her posture and shawl. How she's shown in the app: a live Mary in front of painted background plates (roadmap M24). **Round 6 is done** (2026-11-07, DONE commit on `other/M24-scene`, brief `docs/handoff/done/M24-scene6.md`): the lantern hangs from the ceiling in front of her and to her right, the radio table stands beside the swing, the helmet is satin with no glint, the framing is closer, and the camera eases in when she talks and back when she rests or reaches. Still open from it: the swing chain sits tight on her forearm in the radio reach, the lantern's painted cheeks read as orange patches at a low wick, her hands are cut at the bottom of the talk framing, and the fireflies jump at the loop's wrap. A face round with three faces side by side comes next, after Andy's look.
- **`other/M24-boards`** (round 11 in code) is kept and not merged. The hub settles it after the scene.
- **cleanup1 is merged and published:** rules live only in `docs/decisions.md` (D1-D27) and `docs/how-we-work.md`. The hub's memory matches. Andy's global instructions and the token-saving skill were updated with all 12 proposed changes (2026-11-05, `docs/handoff/done/cleanup1-global-proposals.md`).
- **Repo:** Mary's Porch (github.com/sketch2626/marys-porch); `main` is published after every merge (D17).
- **Fundraising** is handed to Claude Cowork (`private/fundraising/handoff.md`).
- **Loose ends for the hub:** the merged branches are pruned. The leftover plain folder `.worktrees/M9d3` remains (a safety check blocks deleting it). `wip/report-to-state` stays (roadmap M27).

## Waiting on Andy (asked one at a time)
- Answered 2026-11-05: Sam's "Pal" is fine; the shortcut stays "Mary"; removing by voice asks "are you sure?" (D12); the slow-laptop voice is Kokoro (M8); the global-file changes are approved; Sam by a fire, the sky evening-to-night, and the round 6 order (M24).
1. **Her brain:** Gemini's paid tier or the Claude API (roadmap M26).
2. **Leaner's tighter safety wording** (D5), which comes with the brain pick. The old-to-new map is in the M21d merge commit.
3. **The speak-up decisions SD1-SD10** (`docs/speakup-plan.md`, "Decisions for Andy").
4. **The open-source voice** Andy found that works like ElevenLabs: its name or link (roadmap M14).
5. **The five-minute Facebook sign-in test** (`docs/messaging-plan.md`, test 9), before the Messenger step.

## Next, in order
1. **M24:** finish the porch scene, then build the loop studio and the player into the app.
2. **M26, her brain on the paid model:** the pick, the rebuild, the module, and full testing, safety first (D26).
3. **M25,** the porch radio.
4. **Messages:** M15e-j, and a first real Gmail or Yahoo send with a helper.
5. **M27, speaking up:** speak-up S1 onward, after SD1-SD10.
6. **The pilot:** `docs/pilot-checklist.md`, with M28 (lid to Mary and setup).
